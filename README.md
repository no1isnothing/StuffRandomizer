The StuffRandomizer is a simple app to help randomize stuff as the name implies. The orignal use case was rolling characters for me and my friends, but it can be used to assign any people or things to any other people or things.

It's as much practice/a demonstration as anything else. It's all Kotlin, uses Jetpack, Room, Hilt and Junit5. Currently, the goal is to get it into the app store by the end of January.
